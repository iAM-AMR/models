# Directory

You can find more information on models and modules [in the documentation.](https://goto.iam.amr.pub/docs_model_framework)

In brief, the iAM.AMR models are organized into **stories**, or collections of one or more drug-microbe-commodity combinations that together describe an important facet of resistance in the agri-food production system in Canada.

These **story models** are connected to a communal **Hub module**, and various other *modules* to provide data in a standardized plug-and-play fashion.

**To run the story models, you must have a copy of the Hub module.**


## Conventions

Models are named `iAM.AMR.XYZ`, where `XYZ` is a string of 3 -- 4 letters or numbers describing the model. The repositories are are named `iAM.AMR.MODEL_XYZ`.

You should always download a *release* where available.

See the [documentation](https://goto.iam.amr.pub/docs_model_framework) for more details.
