# Welcome to the iAM.AMR Project
This is the private repository of the iAM.AMR project. This repository contains the iAM.AMR models, and non-public project information (e.g. meeting notes and records of decisions).

## Getting Started
### Read the documentation
The iAM.AMR project documentation is available publicly at https://docs.grdi-amr.com.

The new iAM.AMR project site is available publically at https://docs.iam.amr.pub.

### Download the models
The simplest way to get started is to download the entire repository using GitHub Desktop, or as a ZIP file. To download the repository as a ZIP file, use the large green "Clone or download" menu on the right-hand side of the screen to access the "Download ZIP" option.

Unzip and extract the contents to run the models.

### Download specific models
To  download only specific models, open the model files in the file list above. Then, right click on "Raw", and choose "Save link as" or "Save target as" to download the model.

**Note** in some cases, your browser may save the model as a .TXT file. You will need to change this extension to .ANA to open the model.

**Note** that the models require IAM.AMR.BASE.ana to be present in the same directory to function. You can download this module using the same method described above. This module will automatically be present if you choose to download the entire repository as a ZIP file.

### Making changes and uploading those changes using GitHub
To get started with GitHub, we recommend running through the "Hello World" tutorial at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/, which walks you through some of the core concepts of Git, all from within the GitHub interface.
